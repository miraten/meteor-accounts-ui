leesangwon:accounts-ui
======================

Meteor Accounts UI package with modal dialog box style of Bootstrap 3.x

At first, I used [Accounts-entry](https://atmospherejs.com/joshowens/accounts-entry) package.
It is very good UI and works well.

However, I build it from the scratch.

I thought that sign-in, sign-up UI should be based on a dialog box style.
Because it is the state of user.
If the state of user would be changed for some reason, user should not go to another page to update user status.
User can update his or her state at the current page.


Install
